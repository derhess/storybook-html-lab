    Welcome to Storybook for HTML

  <p>
    This is a UI component dev environment for your plain HTML snippets.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    
    We've added some basic stories inside the 
    <code
      class="code"
    >
      stories
    </code>
     directory.
    
    <br />
    
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    
    <br />
    
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
  
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    
    See these sample 
    <a
      class="link"
      data-sb-kind="Demo"
      data-sb-story="button"
      href="#"
    >
      stories
    </a>
    
  
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    <img
      class="logo"
      src="logo.svg"
    />
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    
    Just like that, you can add your own snippets as stories.
    
    <br />
    
    You can also edit those snippets and see changes right away.
    
    <br />
    
  
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    
    Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.
    <br />
    
    Have a look at the
    
    <a
      class="link"
      href="https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories"
